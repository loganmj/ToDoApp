# ToDoApp
A simple tutorial React app that allows users to manage a todo list.
The project includes encapsulated components and uses context hooks to manage state.

# CI/CD
The repository is setup to run a GitHub Actions script whenever code is pushed to main.
This script will build the code, compose it into a docker image, and upload the artifact
to a repository on DockerHub.

Here is a link to the Docker/Github Actions documentation on the Docker website:
